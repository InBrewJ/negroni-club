# Smoke tests

- Does the app load without errors?
- Is the backend URL returning something that indicates its online?
- Can I log in?
- Does the cdktf code synth to something that allows 'plan' to run?

- Might just be a bunch of shell scripts during this exploration
- Might also be a mixture of Playwright + go test integration tests
